        <h2>‚òùü§ì About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Pierre Nguyen, I am a third year software engineering student here at UNSW. This is my mini website made for DevSoc's 25T1 Trainee program with the theme "Around the World" (hence the rotating earth in space). 
        </p>
          
        <p>
          I have some background personal experience with making my own projects and websites but thought it would be nice to learn more indepth and practice some react website building with a team!! I can cook a mean meal (follow recipes really well) and love travelling with my lovely awesome coolest girlfriend :) I am keen to make new friends and I am a patient and eager learner!!!
        </p>

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>

        <p>          
          On the side, I am currently working on a mini finance dashboard project centred around React which I find I am not 
          that proficient in... I made this website following some online tutorials for 3D objects in websites and some basic 
          knowledge in HTML and CSS which I hope is fun to play around with! 
        </p>

        <p>
          I have two current ongoing personal projects which involve React, TypeScript, CSS/Tailwind but they are still in progress... 
          I am heavily focusing on my finance dashboard project so I can gain some experience with server requests, 
          apis and authentication!! I believe DevSoc would be a great learning experience and also something I can add onto 
          my portfolio working as a team to build something cool!! This trainee application allowed me to explore THREE.js and 
          experiment with different objects and animations in the library (super intersting and fun to play around with).
        </p>

        <h2>üèãÔ∏è Interests</h2>
        <p>
         When I am not coding for uni or working my partime retail job, I find myself:
         <ul>
          <li>going to the gym</li>
          <li>playing survial co-op games with my friends</li>
          <li>watching shows (currently watching season 3 of Invinsible)</li>
          <li>music!!</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          I really enjoy live music, so everytime an artist I listen to announces a tour you bet I am first in line for tickets. 
          My favourtie concerts so far have been my favourite kpop girl group Twice (first ever concert and best setlist), 
          Travis Scott (pure energy), Daniel Ceasar (cut short because of thunderstorm outside of the Opera house but was worth every second)..
        </p>

        <p>
          Next up are some snapshots of these concerts!!
