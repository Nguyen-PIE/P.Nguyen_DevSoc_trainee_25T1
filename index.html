        <h2>‚òùü§ì About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Pierre Nguyen, I am a third year software engineering student here at UNSW. This is my mini website made for DevSoc's 25T1 Trainee program with the theme "Around the World" (hence the rotating earth in space). I have some background personal experience with making my own projects and websites but thought it would be nice to learn more indepth and practice some react website building. 
        </p>

        <p>
          On the side, I am currently working on a mini finance dashboard project centred around React which I find I am not that proficient in... I made this website following some online tutorials for 3D objects in websites and some basic knowledge in HTML and CSS which I hope is fun to play around with! 
        </p>

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>

        <p>
          I have two current ongoing personal projects which involve React, TypeScript, CSS/Tailwind but they are still in progress... I am heavily focusing on my finance dashboard project which uses React so I can gain some experience and hopefully apply for banking tech jobs. I believe DevSoc would be a great learning experience and also something I can add onto my portfolio working as a team to build something cool!!
        </p>

        <h2>üèãÔ∏è Interests</h2>

        <p>
